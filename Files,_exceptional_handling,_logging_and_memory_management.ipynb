        "###2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        ">Exception handling in Python is the process of responding to unwanted or unexpected events (exceptions) during program execution by using try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "###3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",

        "###6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        ">import module: Imports the whole module. From module import function: Imports a specific function or class from a module.\n",
        "\n",
        "###7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",

        "###16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
